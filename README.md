# Zidio-Online-Learning-Platform-UI-UX-Redesign
This project represents a full-scale redesign of Zidio’s Online Learning Platform, crafted to enhance clarity, consistency, and usability across devices. I treated the platform like a living system—studying its pulse, understanding its friction points, and guiding it toward a more intuitive and engaging experience.
